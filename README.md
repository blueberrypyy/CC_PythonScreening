<p>Python Screening Questions</p>
</br>

<p>1. Anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another. For example: Silent
is an Anagram of Listen. Write an example program that determines if a pair of words are Anagrams.</p>
</br>

<p>2. Write a Python function that takes in a list of integers (0 through 10) and returns the sum of all the
even numbers in the list.</p>
</br

<p>3. Write a Python function that takes in a list of integers (in this case use 1, -2, 3, 4, -5 and 6) and returns
the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of the list. A subarray is a contiguous portion of the list.</p>
</br>

<p>4. Network devices are identified by its MAC address, which is 6 byte / 12 hex characters
(1234ABCD5678 for example). A RESTful API exists to check the status of a network device
(http://localhost:8000/device/check/1234ABCD5678, another example.)</br></br>
Assume a large dataset exists that contains a large set of device identifiers in the form of MAC addresses
(over 10,000+). The RESTful API can take around 5 seconds to complete a single status check, so
checking device status is a relatively long running task. Also assume that the device identifiers (MAC
addresses) come from a data source / stream that separates each MAC address by a newline.</br></br>
Write a python solution that processes MAC address with the goal of: minimizing runtime, minimizing
resource usage and generalizing methods and procedures.</p>
